# MakeMKV to FFmepeg (direct to MP4)
This Powershell script uses MakeMKV and FFmpeg to pull a back of a DVD/Blu-ray from a purchased copy of your collection to your local inventory for applications such as Plex.tv and Kodi.
The main focus of this was to skip going to an MKV file format and instead go directly from MakeMKV to MP4 using H.264 and hardware acceleration.
